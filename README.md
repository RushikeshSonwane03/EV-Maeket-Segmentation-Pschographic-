EV Market Segmentation
By Rushikesh Sonwane

Introduction:
The purpose of this analysis is to understand the psychographic segmentation of potential electric vehicle (EV) customers based on their demographics, education, income, and attitudes towards EVs. The data was obtained from a survey conducted with a sample of 1000 respondents.

Data Exploration:
The dataset consisted of 15 columns and 1000 rows. The data types included integers, floats, and objects. There were no null values in the dataset.
The analysis explored the following variables: age, marital status, education, profession, annual income, preference for replacing all vehicles with EVs, type of EV preferred, opinion on EVs' economy, current vehicle brand, budget for an EV, preference for wheels in an EV, and belief on whether EVs will replace fuel cars in India.

Data Visualization:
To visualize the pairwise relationships between different attributes, a pair plot was created with the seaborn library. The plot showed that most respondents between the ages of 18 and 75 were in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.
A heatmap was created to visualize the correlation between attributes. The plot showed a positive correlation between age and the number of family members, and between annual income and the budget for an EV.






Insights
The analysis revealed the following insights:
Age: The maximum count of respondents falls between the ages of 18 and 75 years, with most of them being in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.

Marital Status: The count of married respondents was less than single respondents, with both groups in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.

Education: The dataset included two categories, graduates (693) and post-graduates (207). In both categories, respondents were in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.


Profession: The dataset included four categories, none, business, service, and others. Respondents from the business category were the most in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.

Annual Income: Respondents with higher annual incomes were willing to spend more money on an EV.

Budget for an EV: Respondents with a higher budget were more likely to prefer an EV with four wheels. 

Opinion on EVs' economy: Most respondents believed that EVs are economical.

Current vehicle brand: The dataset included multiple vehicle brands, with no clear preference for any brand.

Belief on whether EVs will replace fuel cars in India: Most respondents believed that EVs will replace fuel cars in India.
I compared all attributes with their relative factors and the results are as follows:
Age - Conclusion :
Count of Peoples between the age of 18 to 75 years is Maximum.
And most of them are in favour of to replace all their Vehicles with Electronic Vehicles

Marital Status - Conclusion :
Count of Married Peoples is less which is 262 and Single's are 638.
In both cases Peoples are in favour of to replace all their Vehicles with Electronic Vehicles
Education - Conclusion:
There are two types of values 'Graduate' and 'Post Graduate'.
Total counts are Graduates = 693 & Post Graduates = 207
In both cases both categories are in favour to replace all their Vehicles with Electronic Vehicles


Profession - Conclusion :
There are four categories that are ['None', 'Business', 'Working Professional', 'Salaried'].
In this case too all the categories are in favor to replace all their Vehicles with Electronic Vehicles. Mostly None and Business Profession Peoples.

Overall - Conclusion :
Overall EVs are Preferred at very high on demand on Almost every aspect. But Mostly Four Wheels (SUVs)




 
Here the Scenario changes
No. of Family Members - Conclusion :
Here the value ranges from 1 to 8
Out of which majority are having 4 family members
In these case too Peoples are not in the favour to replace all their Vehicles with Electronic Vehicles.
Whenever whe consider the No. of Family Members factor it will be affect the EV Market segmentation in Opposite order.
Conclusion
The analysis showed that respondents from various demographic backgrounds and education levels were in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs except the ‘No. of Family members’ aspect. Respondents with higher annual incomes and budgets were more willing to purchase an EV, and respondents from the business profession were the most in favor of replacing all their vehicles with EVs.
The Startup can now get a clear Idea that they should develop EVs in a 4-wheeler SUV’s vehicle space and Target the Young and a bit Middle aged Generations which are between 18 – 50 years of Age.
Only One factor can affect them & that is Family Members count. But It can be managed by using other Aspects which Annual Income, Preference, Amount they are ready to spend over EV’s, Education, Marital Status and Profession.
These insights can be useful for the Startup in the EV market to target their marketing and advertising efforts towards potential customers who are more likely to purchase an EV.
